<h2>Personal Life</h2>
<p>Hello! I am Brian Rogers and I'm a San Diego native and a third year Software Development major at <a href="http://allegheny.edu">Allegheny College</a>. What do I like to do in my free time? Great question. I like to spend time with the brothers of my fraternitiy (Delta Tau Delta). I stay active by lifting weights and playing sports. After a lifetime of playing lacrosse I came to Allegheny where I became the president of Allegheny College Mens Lacrosse Club. I enjoy playing intramural soccer and kicking the soccer ball around with my friends. When I am too tired for actual soccer I enjoy moving to the Xbox to beat my friends at the latest FIFA game.</p>

<h2>Computer Science</h2>
<h3>How I found it</h3>
<p>Heading into summer after my first year at college I was content to be an economics major. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my major but I knew that I liked economics and figured it would all work out. A few weeks away from the the start of my second year at school, three things happened within the span of a week that completely altered my course of study. The first thing was seeing <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi68Lb-lo3NAhVG-GMKHYWIDukQFggeMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FFallout%2Fcomments%2F3e0svq%2Fthis_was_how_the_train_in_broken_steel_was%2F&usg=AFQjCNHvQXtuai4RLgoleJZOi_N_1N2_Uw&sig2=pZDy_uIwK0gdNDE63NgkMA">this reddit post </a> which talked about a cool trick used by Fallout 3 developers. I looked at the image and read through some of the comments and got to thinking how clever those developers were. The second thing was speaking to my cousin. She happened to visit the west coast for the first time in a few years. As we talked she told me she had a minor in computer science and I was able to pick her brain on the topic. Lastly, and just days after the previous events, I spoke to a high school friend of mine about how I was thinking about looking into computer science. To my surprise, he said that just a week or two prior he also became interested in computer science! We got together and began looking into the subject and learning to write our first lines of code. I was hooked at once. I immedietly made contact with my advisor at school and completely changed my class schedule to head in the direction of a computer science major. I haven't looked back since. </p>

<h3>What I've done so far</h3>
<p>
I have taken both introductory courses offered by my school. These taught me about problem solving, data structures, and everything else you would typically find in intro courses. I took a visual computing course in using <a href="https://processing.org/"> Processing </a> that was the most fun course I have ever taken. We looked at 2d and 3d computing and the concepts behind making visuals. I loved every second of that course; this was when I knew computer science was for me. I enjoyed writing the final project for my visual computing class so much that I wanted to port it from Processing to Swift and the iOS App Store. I took an independent study course under the same professer who taught my visual computing course in order to do just that: turn my game into a real app for everyone to play. Distributed systems was the hardest course I've taken. It was so fascinating to me, however, that I didn't mind putting in the extra time for this course and really enjoyed learning about how distributed systems work.
</p>

<h3>What I'm doing now</h3>
<p>
I am currently working on completing my app Fratty Bird that I have been working on since the Spring semester of 2016. You can follow the progress of it's completion at <a href="yaoayoyao">my blog </a>
  . I'm aiming to release it before the start of my Fall semester.
