<h2>Personal Life</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm a San Diego native and a third year computer science major at <a href="http://allegheny.edu">Allegheny College</a>. What do I like to do in my free time? Great question. I like to stay active by lifting weights and playing sports. After a lifetime of playing lacrosse I came to Allegheny where I became the president of Allegheny College Mens Lacrosse Club. I am always interested in technology and like to keep up with the latest trends. Within days of writing my first lines of code I knew that computer science was the career path for me. Writing code and working with technology is extremely fun for me and I'm excited to finally get into the professional field.</p>

<h2>Computer Science</h2>
<h3>How I found it</h3>
<p>Heading into summer after my first year of college I was content to be an economics major. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my major but I knew that I liked economics and figured it would all work out. A few weeks away from the the start of my second year at school, three things happened within the span of a week that completely altered my course of study. The first thing was seeing <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi68Lb-lo3NAhVG-GMKHYWIDukQFggeMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FFallout%2Fcomments%2F3e0svq%2Fthis_was_how_the_train_in_broken_steel_was%2F&usg=AFQjCNHvQXtuai4RLgoleJZOi_N_1N2_Uw&sig2=pZDy_uIwK0gdNDE63NgkMA">this reddit post </a> which talked about a cool trick used by Fallout 3 developers. I looked at the image and read through some of the comments and got me thinking about how clever those developers were. The second thing was speaking to my cousin. She happened to visit the west coast for the first time in a few years. As we talked she told me she had a minor in computer science and I was able to pick her brain on the topic. Lastly, and just days after the previous events, I spoke to a high school friend of mine about how I was thinking about looking into computer science. To my surprise, he said that just a week or two prior he also became interested in computer science! We got together and began looking into the subject and learning to write our first lines of code. I was hooked at once. I immedietly made contact with my advisor at school and completely changed my class schedule to head in the direction of a computer science major. I haven't looked back since. </p>

<h3>My interests within the field</h3>
<p>
I am really interested in working with large systems. I took a course on distributed systems in 2016 and found it to be very complex and intriguing. Additionally I am interested in cyber security. Although I have yet to take an academic course in that field I am doing research into the topic independently.

<h3>Some of my favorite projects</h3>
<p>
<u><b>Fratty Bird - The Game</b></u> - <i> Available on the App Store. Written in Swift </i>
<br>
Fratty Bird is an iOS app that I developed single handedly from concept to product. I had the original idea and wrote a <a href="https://github.com/BrianJMRogers/Fratty-Bird">concept version</a> in the Processing language in the fall of 2015. I liked the concept version so much that I decided to embark upon the journey of creating an iOS version. I had no prior knowledge of building iOS apps but I knew I would need to learn. I began construction in the new year of 2016. I taught myself Xcode and Swift and with the help of various textbooks and online tutorials. At the end of the summer of 2016 Fratty Bird - The Game was accepted into the App Store for anyone to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fratty-bird-the-game/id1143642394?mt=8">download and play</a>.

<p>
<u><b>A Distributed Heuristic</b></u> - <i> Available on GitHub. Written in Java </i>
<br>
I worked on this project in a 4 person group in my distributed systems course in 2016. We decided upon applying a hill-climbing algorithm to the knapsack problem. The group consisted of two seniors who had no interest in working thus the project fell to myself and the remaining member. Looking back I couldn't be happier that this happened. The other working member wrote the heuristic and I wrote the distribution. As a result, I had an immense amount of fun while also gaining some valuable experience. You can check out the full project <a href="https://github.com/BrianJMRogers/Distributed-Hill-Climbing-Knapsack">here</a>.

<p>
<u><b>A Snowy Neighborhood</b></u> - <i> Available on GitHub. Written in Processing </i>
<br>
Take a walk through a neighborhood in wintertime during a light snowfall! I wrote this project in 2015 using what I learned in a visual computing course. The project required that I understand the concepts behind building in a 3D environment. You can take a tour of the neighborhood <a href="https://github.com/BrianJMRogers/Neighborhood">here</a>.
