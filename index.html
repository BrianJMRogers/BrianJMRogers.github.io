<h2>Personal Life</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm a San Diego native and a forth year computer science major at <a href="http://allegheny.edu">Allegheny College</a> where I will graduating in the spring of 2018. Within the realm of computer science I am particularly interested in cybersecurity and low-level systems. In my free time I like to create apps which I post on the iOS App Store. Outside of computer science, I like staying active by lifting weights or playing sports like soccer or lacrosse. I enjoy music and host a weekly radio show called Chill JamZ at Allegheny College. I've been to 13 countries around the world (the Netherlands has been my favorite) and really like to travel. The rest of this page document's some of my favorite personal projects that I've worked on. </p>


<h2>Some of my favorite projects</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/BrianJMRogers/Distributed-Hill-Climbing-Knapsack">Distributed Hill Climbing Knapsack</a> - <i> Available on GitHub. Written in Java </i>
<br>
This is another favorite project of mine. Ever since I took a course in Distrbuted Systems I've been fascinated by working with a large cohesive system. The power and complexity of these systems really peaks my interest and I hope to work with one such system during my career. This project distributes a hill climbing algorithm across any number of client nodes before returning a result back to the server.

<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fratty-bird-the-game/id1143642394?mt=8">Fratty Bird</a> - <i>Available on the App Store, written in Swift </i>
<br>
Fratty Bird is an iOS app that I developed single handedly from concept to product. I had the original idea and wrote a <a href="https://github.com/BrianJMRogers/Fratty-Bird">concept version</a> in the Processing language in the fall of 2015. I liked the concept version so much that I decided to embark upon the journey of creating an iOS version. I had no prior knowledge of building iOS apps but I knew I would need to learn. I began construction in the new year of 2016. I taught myself Xcode and Swift and with the help of various textbooks and online tutorials. At the end of the summer of 2016 Fratty Bird - The Game was accepted into the App Store for anyone to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fratty-bird-the-game/id1143642394?mt=8">download and play</a>.

<a href="https://github.com/BrianJMRogers/Race-Conditions-Demo">Race Conditions Demo</a> - <i> Available on GitHub. Written in Java </i>
<br>
The purpose of this demo is to visually convey what race conditions are. I liked working on this project because using multithreading brought a whole set of challenges and difficulties that I think I could only have appreciated after overcoming them.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/BrianJMRogers/Bubble-Chart-Maker">Bubble Chart Maker</a> - <i> Available on GitHub. Written in Java </i>
<br>
This project was particularly fun to work on because the algorithm was a bit challenging to impliment. The prompt for this project was to dynamically create a packed bubble chart where each bubble touched other bubbles without overlapping them regardless of bubble size and count.
